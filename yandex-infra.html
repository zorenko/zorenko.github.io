          While working on Infrastructure services I've completed several tasks and goals. For example, while I was working on YT, I've designed a Resource planner, Schema editor and a Dark theme. For Logbroker goals were even more complex. We needed to switch to a new resource model — hierarchical and to add the ability to configure the system from UI.

          Redesigned the whole service in 2 months.
          Acomplished two big tasks: switch to a new resource model — hierarchical, designed UI that allowed to configure the system from UI.

        <p>
          In infrastructure services main users are Yandex employees, so it is very convenient for a designer to work closely with users and discover their needs, pain points and collect a feedback. Before I've started working on YT tasks, I was introduced to the system in general. I learned what nodes, chunks, YQL are, that YT has dynamic tables, a distributed file system and processing system.

          Capacity planner is a tool for estimation of how many resources (storage and processing) would you need and ordering them.
          On the screen we are showing stats on how many resources you are consuming and a trajectory for estimated future consumption.

          Dark theme
        </h3>
        <p>
          The goal was to update a color scheme for light and a11y themes of the platform and create a dark theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          The UI of a platform used too many similar colours (several greens, reds, etc.), plus some colours weren't very user-friendly (like green was too bright). That was a legacy from a lot of previous designers who worked on a platform before. Colours created problems for both users and developers. I needed to systemise, reduce and update a color palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was working on a task, I took several colours-rich screens of the platform and started to look for patterns, similarities and differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end I've created a big palette of old colours that were used in the UI and started systemise and enhance them. By the end of this process I've collected a new updated palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          We worked closely with developers and some users and they consulted me on where some colours might not work and what decisions might confuse platform users.
        </p>
        <p>
          After getting together light theme color palette I've started working on dark theme. When it was done, we've announced that color update in Yandex internal blog system. In general, YT users were very happy with an update and excited about dark theme.
